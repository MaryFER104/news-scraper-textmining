# news-scraper-textmining
Automated news web scraper with Selenium + PostgreSQL and WordCloud text analysis.

# 📰 Web Scraping

This project implements an automated pipeline for news headline extraction and analysis using web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and results visualization. The goal is to demonstrate how to integrate Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to transform unstructured data into useful information.

## 📌 Descripción
- **Automated** the extraction of **76 news headlines** through web scraping, enabling a structured dataset for text analysis.  
- **Processed** the text using NLP techniques to identify key terms, generating the **Top 10 most relevant words** such as *“méxico”*, *“noroña”* and *“checo pérez”*.  
- **Applied** Python and data science libraries to clean, tokenize, and normalize text, ensuring accuracy in frequency calculations and insights.  
- **Delivered** an interactive pipeline that combines scraping and analysis, showcasing the power of Machine Learning workflows in real-world text mining tasks.  

## 🛠️ Tecnologías utilizadas
- Python (Pandas, NLTK, Matplotlib, WordCloud)  
- Selenium para web scraping  
- PostgreSQL para almacenamiento estructurado  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab para análisis  

## 📊 Resultados
- 76 news headlines extracted.  
- Identification of the 10 most frequent words
- Reproducible workflow that integrates scraping, cleaning, and analysis. 
- Text visualizations using WordCloud and frequency charts.
